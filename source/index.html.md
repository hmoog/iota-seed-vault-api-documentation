# Introduction

Welcome to the IOTA Seed Vault - API! If you are developing a IOTA wallet, you can use our APIs to provide higher security to your customers. In particular, since the funds are secured with multiple seeds, you can offer a wallet that is secure even if the user's computer is compromised with a keylogger.

If you run a business that handles high volumes of IOTA, our payed APIs will allow you to construct flexible custom security policies around authorizing transactions. These policies can protect against inside job and "gun to the head" security threats.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

IOTA Seed Vault uses two-factor auth tokens to allow automated access to restricted  keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
